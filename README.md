# Calculator

I created a Web Calculator using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Creating this helped me better understand functional programming and DOM manipulation using event listeners. The page is responsive to viewport size and is functional on mobile. The dynamic background used for this page is from [Vanta JS](https://github.com/tengbao/vanta).
